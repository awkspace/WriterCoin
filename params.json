{"name":"WriterCoin","tagline":"The world's first crit-o-currency.","body":"# Welcome to WriterCoin.\r\nFor years, if not decades, writers have struggled with attaching a value to the written word. WriterCoin changes all that by introducing a currency specifically **for writers**.\r\n\r\nDesigned from the ground up to be innovative, creative, and art-loving, WriterCoin will change the way you look at all forms of the written word, from Aristotle's *Republic* to dirty Sonic the Hedgehog fanfiction.\r\n\r\n![](http://webgel.net/bf/WC_01d.png)\r\n\r\n## Powered by art.\r\nHate the idea of making real, dirty, commercialized money from your writing? We do too. Writing shouldn't be about trading in your soul for money &mdash; it should be about trading art for art. WriterCoin aims to facilitate that trade as an art-centric currency.\r\n\r\nArt has inherent value and power that our economy of greed cannot touch. That's why WriterCoin's motto is *Verpa Fortiorem*: \"The Pen is Mightier.\" With WriterCoin, we as writers can float above the day-to-day grind and focus on consuming and creating new art.\r\n\r\n![](http://jonathanstorment.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/3863527796_f0f2dabac2_z.jpg)\r\n\r\n## By writers. Made for writing.\r\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies that are based on complicated math problems nobody cares about, WriterCoin is earned by using that **liberal arts degree** you always insisted would come in handy. For every ten words of prose you write, you receive one WriterCoin.\r\n\r\nDon't write on a computer? Later this month, WriterCoin will be launching a new wifi-powered miner block that attaches to virtually any typewriter. Now you're earning money by writing just like a real professional does, with none of the compromises.\r\n\r\n![](http://www.kaffein.ru/images/Starbucks_3_b.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Collaboration-ready.\r\nWriterCoin exists to help you further your writing. It is the world's first *crit-o-currency*, a currency that can be traded in anytime, anywhere to get a critique from a fellow writer.\r\n\r\nThe applications don't stop there, however. At a rate of ten words to a WriterCoin, an Amazon cover picture will only cost about a hundred WriterCoin. We are currently in talks with Starbucks to accept WriterCoin in exchange for coffee, provided that coffee is used to fuel more obnoxious coffeeshop writing.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/modules/open_graph/github-mark.png)\r\n\r\n## Open source.\r\nWriterCoin aims to be the most open-source cryptocurrency ever made. WriterCoin is so open source, in fact, that it doesn't even exist yet. The code and support will come from you, the writing community, to make WriterCoin the coin that *you* want it to be.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
