{"name":"WriterCoin","tagline":"The world's first crit-o-currency","body":"# Welcome to WriterCoin.\r\nFor years, if not decades, writers have struggled with attaching a value to the written word. WriterCoin changes all that by introducing a currency specifically **for writers**.\r\n\r\nDesigned from the ground up to be innovative, creative, and art-loving, WriterCoin will change the way you look at all forms of the written word, from Aristotle's *Republic* to dirty Sonic the Hedgehog fanfiction.\r\n\r\n## Powered by art.\r\nHate the idea of making real, dirty, commercialized money from your writing? We do too. Writing shouldn't be about trading in your soul for money &mdash; it should be about trading art for art. WriterCoin aims to facilitate that trade as an art-centric currency.\r\n\r\nArt has inherent value and power that our economy of greed cannot touch. That's why WriterCoin's motto is *Verpa Fortiorem*: \"The Pen is Mightier.\" With WriterCoin, we as writers can float above the day-to-day grind and focus on consuming and creating new art.\r\n\r\n## By writers. For writers.\r\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies that are based on complicated math problems nobody cares about, WriterCoin is earned by using that **liberal arts degree** you always insisted would come in handy. For every ten words of prose you write, you receive one WriterCoin.\r\n\r\nDon't write on a computer? Later this month, WriterCoin will be launching a new wifi-powered miner block that attaches to virtually any typewriter. Now you aren't just writing, you're *mining*.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
