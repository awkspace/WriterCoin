<a name="welcome-to-writercoin" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-writercoin"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to WriterCoin.</h1>

<p>For years, if not decades, writers have struggled with attaching a value to the written word. WriterCoin changes all that by introducing a currency specifically <strong>for writers</strong>.</p>

<p>Designed from the ground up to be innovative, creative, and art-loving, WriterCoin will change the way you look at all forms of the written word, from Aristotle's <em>Republic</em> to dirty Sonic the Hedgehog fanfiction.</p>

<h2>
<a name="powered-by-art" class="anchor" href="#powered-by-art"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Powered by art.</h2>

<p>Hate the idea of making real, dirty, commercialized money from your writing? We do too. Writing shouldn't be about trading in your soul for money â€” it should be about trading art for art. WriterCoin aims to facilitate that trade as an art-centric currency.</p>

<p>Art has inherent value and power that our economy of greed cannot touch. That's why WriterCoin's motto is <em>Verpa Fortiorem</em>: "The Pen is Mightier." With WriterCoin, we as writers can float above the day-to-day grind and focus on consuming and creating new art.</p>

<h2>
<a name="by-writers-for-writers" class="anchor" href="#by-writers-for-writers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>By writers. For writers.</h2>

<p>Unlike other cryptocurrencies that are based on complicated math problems nobody cares about, WriterCoin is earned by using that <strong>liberal arts degree</strong> you always insisted would come in handy. For every ten words of prose you write, you receive one WriterCoin.</p>

<p>Don't write on a computer? Later this month, WriterCoin will be launching a new wifi-powered miner block that attaches to virtually any typewriter. Now you aren't just writing, you're <em>mining</em>.</p>
